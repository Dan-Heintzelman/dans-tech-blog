I'm writing this post for two reasons. The first being to reflect on how I'm feeling 4 weeks deep into Chicago Dev Bootcamp, and secondly, to reflect on my thoughts on the future of "learning to code" in a bootcamp style environment.

### A reflection

I am currently a student at Chicago Dev Bootcamp. If you are unfamiliar with this type of program, then you probably can already guess what it's like. Take military bootcamp, transpose pushup with writing code. Ok, let me stop right there. The intensity is pretty similar to what I imagine a real bootcamp would be like, however, the environment is much, much, much more emotionally supportive. Let me try again. Take military bootcamp, transpose the pushups for code, add yoga, emotional intelligence classes, optional counseling, and fun group activities (like the talent show we have every week) and you've almost got it.

Mix in a bunch of friendly eager folks, a work environment littered with hammocks, musical instruments, bean bags, and...well, fresh coffee brewed aroundt the clock, and now you have a clearer picture.
